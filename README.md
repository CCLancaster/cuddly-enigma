# cuddly-enigma

Hello shiny new world.

Why am I here? Why am I venturing into a field of work so varied as to touch every corner of the known universe? Especially a universe I've only ever been on the outside looking in, like a child outside a toy shop, nose smashed against the pane and excited breathing fogging up the glass. So many reasons. So many pros and so many cons. In the end, I have found it is better to move forward into the unkown light than to circle in the small sphere of impossible fears.

So, fellow adventurers, you are welcome to observe, interact or wave as I journey into this bright new sky. Next stop, is a world of coding languages, steep learning curves and sheer exhaustion. They call it General Assembly (or GA for short). I know there must be something wrong with me, because I am incandecently excited for all that is to come!

See everyone around the 'Verse!

Daringly,
CCLancaster
